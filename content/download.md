# Visit GitHub for the most recent release

Processing 4.0 beta 4 now includes updated 32- and 64-bit downloads for the Pi. Download them from the [releases](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases) page on Github. This site will be updated when someone has time.

~~The most recent build is the .tgz archive toward the bottom of this page. That is version 3.5.3 which was released in February 2019.~~

We don't currently have a maintainer for the Raspberry Pi release. We finally have new releases for Processing 4, but we probably won't be producing images, or able to provide much support without additional help.

# Raspberry Pi Image

~~This is the recommended, and easiest way to get started:~~

Please use a more recent download from the [releases](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases) page on GitHub.

Follow [Get Started](../get-started) for instructions how to install this image file.

# Install Processing onto existing installation

_Alternatively_, if you already have an existing installation of Raspbian you want to keep, you can install Processing by running the following in a terminal:

```shell
curl https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh | sudo sh
```


# Tar-balls

_Lastly_, if you are an expert user, and know your way around Linux, you can also manually download and install the compressed archives below. Those also come with a copy of Java built-in.
